# Safer half-open range operator

* Proposal: [SE-NNNN](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0065-array-slicing-open-range.md)
* Author(s): [Luis Henrique Borges](https://github.com/luish)
* Status: TBD

## Introduction

This proposal seeks to provide a safer `..<`
(aka [half-open range operator](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/510f29abf77e202780c11d5f6c7449313c819030/stdlib/public/core/Range.swift#L193))
in order to avoid `Array index out of range` errors during the execution time.

Swift-evolution thread: [link to the discussion thread for that proposal](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.swift.evolution/14252)

## Motivation

Doing that in Swift causes a runtime error:

```swift
let a = [1,2,3]
let b = a[0..<5]
print(b)
```

```
> Error running code:
> fatal error: Array index out of range
```

In comparison with other languages (often referred to as
"modern languages"), we see the exact behavior I am
going after in this proposal.

Python:

```python
>>> a = [1,2,3]
>>> a[:5]
[1, 2, 3]
```

Ruby:

```ruby
> a = [1,2,3]
> a[0...5]
=> [1, 2, 3]
```

Considering that, the motivation is to avoid validations
on the array size before slicing it, using purely:

```swift
b = a[0..<5]
```

instead of:

```swift
if a.count > 5 {
  b = a[0..<5]
}
```

## Proposed solution

The proposed solution is to slice the array returning all elements that are
below the half-open operator, even though the number of elements is lesser
than the ending of the range.

```swift
let a = [1,2,3]
let b = a[0..<5]
print(b)

> [1,2,3]
```

This would eliminate the need for verifications on the array size before
slicing it -- and consequently runtime errors in cases when the programmer didn't.

## Detailed design

It does not require any change in the language syntax. It is all about
the internal behavior of the existing implementation for the operator
when applied to arrays.

## Impact on existing code

It does not cause any impact on existing code.

## Alternatives considered

### 1. New labeled _subscript_ methods over Collections

The [mail list discussion](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.swift.evolution/14252/focus=14382) converged in a wider improvement in the language that surely is worth considering.

The main point is to provide a convenient interface to let the user slice _collections_ implicit and explicitly through new labeled _subscript_ alternatives. Using this approach the current "fail fast" behaviour would not be touched at all.

#### - subscript(`truncate` range: Range&lt;Int&gt;)

Returns exactly what I proposed initially, clamping the range to the array's bounds, i.e. `array.indices`, before applying the subscript on it. In the following example

```swift
let a = [1,2,3]
let b = a[truncate: -1 ..< 5]
```

the range would be converted to `[0 ..< 3]` and `b` would result in `[1,2,3]`.

#### - subscript(`safe` range: Range&lt;Int&gt;)

Returns `nil` whenever the range is out of bounds, instead of throwing a _fatal error_ in execution time. This behaviour would be consistent if compared with dictionaries, other collection type in which the _subscript_ function returns `nil` if the dictionary does not contain the key given by the user.

Applying this operator in the previous examples,

```swift
let a = [1,2,3]
let b = a[safe: 0 ..< 5]
```

would produce `b` equal to `nil`.


In summary, considering `a = [1,2,3]`:

- `a[0 ..< 5]` results in _fatal error_, the current implementation.
- `a[truncate: 0 ..< 5]` produces `[1,2,3]` just like originally proposed here.
- `a[safe: 0 ... 5]` returns `nil` indicating that the range is invalid, but does not throw an error.

#### 2. New operator `&..<`

As [proposed by Haravikk and Vladimir in the mail list thread](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.swift.evolution/14252/focus=14253), perhaps a variation of the operator would be a better approach, making the user responsible for deciding whether to use the operator implicit or explicitly, just like [Overflow Operators](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/AdvancedOperators.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH27-ID37) do.

Considering a new operator, let's say `&..<` (aka _'safer half-open operator'_), the following statement

```swift
let a = [1,2,3]
let b = a[-1 &..< 5]
```

would be equivalent to `let b = a[max(-1, a.startIndex) ..< min(5, a.endIndex)]`, which becomes `let b = a[0 ..< 3]` and does not raise any error or throw any exception in execution time.

Another alternative would be to make this operator `Throwable`
